# Future Directions

1. How often do the I2C sensors fail? do the python exception handling completely take care of the sensor failures, or are you doing something different?
2. Light incident on sensor and plants is different.
3. How did you tune the variability of inputs (light / water) to control output (green in NVDI)? Are you using any other sensor for measuring the health of the plants?
4. Is there a plant model that can be used?
5. How are you taking the case study forward?
6. What nutrients are you giving to the plants and how are you measuring the effect?
