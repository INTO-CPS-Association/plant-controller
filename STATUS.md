* Two case studies look closer to completion

## Case Study - 1

This case study has

* Three large plants
* One Raspberry Pi 5
* SHT45 (temperature and humidity) and BH1750 (light) sensors
* Three 15V submersible DC motors
* One IoT relay
* One 3 to 26V variable DC power supply

Pending tasks are:

* Three long stemma-to-stemmaQT cables to connect soil moisture sensors to plants
* Three stands to properly place watering pipes in the plants
* Replace BH1750 with AS7341 light sensor and change the controller code

## Case Study - 2

This case study has

* Two medium size basil plants
* One Raspberry Pi 4
* SHT40 (temperature and humidity) and BH1750 (light) sensors
* Pimoroni automationHAT
* Three 5V submersible DC motors
* One I2C passive hub

Pending tasks are:

* Test pimoroni automationHAT with sensors via I2C hub
* Two stands to properly place watering pipes in the plants
* write controller code
